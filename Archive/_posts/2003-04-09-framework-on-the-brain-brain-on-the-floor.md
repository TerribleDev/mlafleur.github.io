<P><FONT face=Arial><A target="_blank"  href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/JLerman/posts/5069.aspx">Julie </A>has made me feel guilty for focusing on the language more than .NET itself. I admit that I've ignored large swaths of .NET in my desire to get up to speed on the languages (C#, VB.NET). In hindsight, I've probably short-changed myself in the process because so much of what makes up .NET is contained in the Framework rather than the language itself.</FONT></P>
