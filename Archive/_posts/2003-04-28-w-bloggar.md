I have to say, <a href="http://massivescale.blob.core.windows.net/blogmedia/2003/04/wbloggar.com" target="_blank">w.bloggar's</a> interface is quite nice. I finally understand why so many folks didn't like using a web interface to post to their blog.

One item to note, the word "blog" isn't included in the spell checker dictionary. :)
