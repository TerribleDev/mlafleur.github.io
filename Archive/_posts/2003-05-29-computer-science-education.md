<P><SPAN class=437114316-29052003><FONT face=Arial size=2>I had the pleasure of 
interviewing a recent college graduate the other day. While he was one of the 
smartest kids I've met in some time, I was utterly shocked at how many holes 
where in his formal education. What is even more disheartening is that I have 
also learned that his experience is very much the norm.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=437114316-29052003><FONT face=Arial size=2>What struck me the 
most was how anti-Microsoft he was (the entire college world for the matter). Is 
every professor looking to turn out a legion of Microsoft haters to go fight 
to&nbsp;"good fight"? With 90+% of the world running Windows, this is quite a 
disservice to their students. The fact is, there are not a lot of Linux 
development positions out there for these kids. And&nbsp;Open Source doesn't 
put&nbsp;much food on the table.&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN></P>
