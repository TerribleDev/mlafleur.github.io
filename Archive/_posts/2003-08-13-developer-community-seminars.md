<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had the pleasure of attending on of Microsoft's new "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/seminar/dcc/default.mspx">Developer Community Seminars</a>" today. One of the nice things about being a developer in New England the last few years has been Russ Fustino and his "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/usa/newengland/russtoolshed/default.asp">Russ' Tool Shed</a>" quarterly seminars.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When Microsoft moved Russ to Florida a month or so ago, I was afraid I had seen the last of the "tell it like it is" development seminars. Let's face it, most of these seminars are "tell it like marketing says it is".Â Â And while those marketing seminars might present a nice excuse to get away, they are almost always more noise than signal.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm happy to say my fears were completely unfounded. The presentation I say today, put on by <a href="http://www.managedcode.com">Joe Stagner</a>, was everything I hoped it would be. To say he "told it like it is" would just not do it justice.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now ifÂ they could just get him into an orange hard-hat with a <a href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks.asp">Carl Franklin</a> song playing over the sound system... :)</font></p><div><p>[Now Playing: Unknown - Chapter 7 (00:00)]</p></div>
