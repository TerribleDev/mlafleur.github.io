<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I've been working with the Compact Framework the last few days and I'm really in love with it. Talk about simplifying PDA development. Wow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>In a matter of hours I had a simple UI that could connect to our existing Web Service API, search for a customer record, and then edit&nbsp;that record. And most of that time was spent&nbsp;working on the UI (I'm still getting used to such a small screen area to work with). Pretty sweet if you ask me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The only thing I wish they could enhance is the events for the controls. More precisely, it would be nice if each control supported a Click event. Currently most do not, so you need to do some playing in order to get a click-able image for example. Not really a big deal, but it would have saved me some extra work last night. </FONT></P>
