<P>So there you are reading some documentation, every so lightly tapping you pen against your forehead. You are in the zone when suddenly you realize:</P>
<OL>
<LI>That pen is a Sharpie.</LI>
<LI>The cover for said Sharpie is on the desk in front of you.</LI>
<LI>Your forehead now resembles a Rorschach Ink Blot.</LI></OL>
<P>Sometimes life is complicated....</P>
