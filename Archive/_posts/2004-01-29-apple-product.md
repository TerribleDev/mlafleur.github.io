<P>I have to agree with <A href="http://www.kstati.com/tabula/archive/2004/01/28/1106.aspx" target=_blank>Peter Rysavy</A> on the overall quality of <A href="http://www.apple.com/" target=_blank>Apple</A>&#8217;s products. They make <I><SPAN>very</SPAN></I> nice equipment that just seems to work.</P>
<P>I should disclose that my first home PC was an Apple (<A href="http://members.aol.com/ljsilicon/" target=_blank>Apple ][ Forever</A>) and my first real career in computers was as an Apple Macintosh technician. So I obviously hold a bias towards them (and an unnatural distain for <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley" target=_blank>John Sculley</A>, but that is another topic altogether).</P>
<P>There are plenty of things I dislike about their products. But compared to what comes out of Hewlett Packard/Compaq/DEC/We-Buy-Everyone, Gateway, and Dell? Those bozos are enough to drive even <A href="http://www.acahome.org/deus/peter/peter.jpg" target=_blank>Saint Peter</A> to curse for a month.</P>
<P>But alas, I&#8217;m far to infatuated with .NET to ever make the switch. C# is literally the most fun I&#8217;ve had in years. And a developer I really appreciate the effort Microsoft puts into support us. Apple can&#8217;t hold a candle to Microsoft in this regard.</P>
<P>The real question is what to do if Microsoft decides to support .NET on the Macintosh platform. Dare I dream?</P></DIV>
