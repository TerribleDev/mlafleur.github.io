<P><SPAN><A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/" target=_blank>Rory Blyth</A> is just too damn funny for a <A href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/" target=_blank>show that runs during working hours</A>. It is a little hard to call anything &#8220;work related&#8221; when one spends the entire time bursting into laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>And my thoughts on what Microsoft does with the hackers people turn in? They drag them into the basement of Building 6 (why 6? because why not 6&#8230;) and force them to&nbsp;listen to Steve Ballmer shout &#8220;<A href="http://www.ntk.net/media/developers.mpg" target=_blank>Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers</A>&#8221; for 48 hours (or until Mr. Ballmer collapses due to lack of oxygen).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG>: It just occurred to me that&nbsp;Seems that Steve Ballmer and Howard Dean <EM>must</EM> share the same speech writer.</SPAN></P></DIV>
