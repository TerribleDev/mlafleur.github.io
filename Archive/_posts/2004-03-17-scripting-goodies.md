<div class="Section1"> <p>While I was compiling the links for this post, I came across another article by Roy titled &ldquo;<A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/articles/DotNetScripting.aspx" target="_blank">Make your .Net application support scripting - a practical approach</a>&rdquo; that is a great example of how to use the tried and true Microsoft Script Control in a .NET application.</p> <p>&nbsp;I had thought about using scripting a while back but decided against it due to the complexity. But I hadn&rsquo;t thought of using the Microsoft Script Control to accomplish it. Roy on the other had did just that.</p></div>
