<p>I was looking at the .NET 3.0 site today and noticed something I had previously missed. Under <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/support/relnotes/netfxRc1/default.aspx#topic1" target="_blank">Supported Operating Systems</a> it lists the following:</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 1 (SP1)  <li>Windows XP SP2  <li>Windows Vista Release Candidate</li></ul> <p>The removal of 9x and NT from the mix was expected. But the removal of Windows 2000 SP3 surprised me quite a bit. </p> <p>A lot of people are just now starting to cycle out their Windows 2000 servers. I wonder if rather than leading to faster server replacement this lead to slower adoption of .Net 3.0.</p> <p>I fully understand why they want to focus on the new platforms but I was a bit surprised by it. Especially when you consider that .NET 3.0 is - from my understanding of it - really just 2.0 with WinFX support. </p>
