Image Importer provides an enhanced photo importation over the default Photos app included with Windows 8.1. Specifically it adds two features previously available in Windows Essentials Live Gallery -Â the ability to import files into folders by Date Taken and remove files from the source media when completed. I developed this utility for my personal use but decided to publish it after hearing other's in the community looking for these features. I've tested this with all sorts of removable media as well as Canon EOS and Olympus DLSR cameras. If you run into issues please drop me a line and I'll get it fixed for you. Known Issues:
<ul>
	<li>Do to API limitations, Image Importer does not support MTP at this time. Most cameras support both MTP and PTP (also called Storage mode). Using the later will enable Image Importer to see your media.</li>
</ul>
