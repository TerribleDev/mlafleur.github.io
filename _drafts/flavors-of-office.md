There is a lot of confusion out there around Office 365 and Office 2016. The most common misconception being that Office 365 is the "online version" while Office 2016 is for desktops. Let's try and clear this up somewhat. 

At it's core, the primary difference between Office 365 and Office 2016 is licensing. Office 365 is a subscription plan that comes in many flavors and encompasses both client applications and backend services. Office 2016 on the other hand is a one-time purchase, otherwise known as a "perpetual license". 

It is true that Office 365 includes a "online" editions for most major client applications (Word Online, Excel Online, etc.) but most also include full desktop clients for both Windows and Mac. These desktop versions are functionally identical to their traditional Office 2016 counter parts.
