<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><em>Also, commenting on other peoples blogs is inconvenient because you have to manually go back and check whether you've been flamed :P or not :-) <br />[</em><a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/DNeimke/posts/4910.aspx"><em>DNeimke</em></a><em>]</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a mighty good point. It would be nice if there was a better way to handle comments. They lend themselves to a message board format but in practical terms that are more like shouts from the peanut gallery.</p>
<p>Personally, I tend to only leave a comment if it does not require a response. Otherwise I make my own blog entry or leave the entire subject to fade into memory. <br /></p>
