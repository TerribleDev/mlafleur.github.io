<p><font face=Arial><a target="_blank"  href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/JLerman/posts/5069.aspx">Julie </a>has made me feel guilty for focusing on the language more than .NET itself. I admit that I've ignored large swaths of .NET in my desire to get up to speed on the languages (C#, VB.NET). In hindsight, I've probably short-changed myself in the process because so much of what makes up .NET is contained in the Framework rather than the language itself.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial>So, with this in mind, I've spend the last two days digging into the multitude of classes in the .NET Framework. One thing I've learned is that <b>&nbsp;there are a lot of damn classes.</b></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial>My only question; is there a function to put my brain back into my head? It seems to have melted and drained out my ear sometime around class number 4,000....</font></p>
