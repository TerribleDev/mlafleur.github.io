Title: More on SpamNet
Excerpt: ""

This is just an update on my <a href="http://dotnetweblogs.com/MLafleur/posts/5353.aspx">SpamNet </a>experience so far:

<ul>
<li>Hours Running: 72</li>
<li>Spam Filtered: 894</li>
<li>Spam Missed: 1</li>
<li>Non-Spam Tagged as Spam: 0</li></ul>
If 894 spam messages seems high to you (someone said it did) then feel for me. I've had the same email address for over a decade so I'm on just about every list ever published.
