<p><font face=Arial>I just bumped into an Anti-Spam tool that actually seems to work. It has caught 100% of the Spam coming into my In-box for the last 48 hours without ANY interaction on my part. </font></p>
<p><font face=Arial>It is an Outlook Add-in so it is seamless (no external program to scrub your email first, nothing server side required). This was something I've wanted for a while now.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial>And at $0.00, the price is just right. :)</font></p>
