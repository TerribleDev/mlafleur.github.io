<a href="/assets/wp/2003/05/www.borland.com" target="_blank">Borland</a> just released the <a href="http://www.borland.com/opt_profiler/index.html" target="_blank">Optimizeit Profiler for .NET</a>. I had the opportunity to see this little guy at the Windows/VS Studio 2003 Launch Event in Boston the other day. It was pretty impressive and relatively easy to configure.

As with everything Borland, the $699 price tag is a bit much. I&#8217;ve not used many profiling tools in the past so maybe it is competitive. But for someone like me who doesn&#8217;t have a desperate need, just a strong desire, it is more than I&#8217;m willing to toss into the budget.
