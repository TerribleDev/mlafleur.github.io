I had the opportunity to see this little guy at the Windows/VS Studio 2003 Launch Event in </span><span>Boston</span><span> the other day.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As with everything Borland, the $699 price tag is a bit much. I&#8217;ve not used many profiling tools in the past so maybe it is competitive. But for someone like me who doesn&#8217;t have a desperate need, just a strong desire, it is more than I&#8217;m willing to toss into the budget. </span></p>
