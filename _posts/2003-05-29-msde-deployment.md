<p><span class=171010720-29052003><font face=Arial size=2>This question was 
posed to me at a development meeting and I simply could not think of an answer. 
</font></span></p>
<p><span class=171010720-29052003><font face=Arial size=2>If a user has SQL 
Server 2000 installed and then installs an instance of MSDE 2000, do the limits 
of MSDE remain? </font></span><span class=171010720-29052003><font face=Arial 
size=2>In other words, will that MSDE instance be limited to 5 batch jobs and 
have the same performance degradation that MSDE alone would 
have?</font></span></p>
