<span class="375383905-06062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">And just when I 
thought everything was going good, a virtual hammer falls on my knee. Just a 
minute ago, I heard that <a href="http://massivescale.blob.core.windows.net/blogmedia/2003/06/russtoolshed">Russ 
FustinoÂ is leaving New England </a>for Florida!</font></span>

<span class="375383905-06062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">For those of you not 
in New England, Russ is a legend around here. For the last 5 years he has run 
the most entertaining technology seminars I've ever had the please of 
attending.Â </font></span>

<span class="375383905-06062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks for the fun 
Russ. </font></span>
