<p><span class="859301415-19062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I downloaded <a href="http://g.msn.com/7MEEN_US/PREVIEW/EN/SETUP.EXE">MSN 6</a> yesterday and 
aside from some issues signing in, it seems to work great.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="859301415-19062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">My only gripe is that 
they <strong>still</strong> have not added my favorite ICQ feature; the ability 
set your status (offline, busy, available, etc) for each person individually. I 
used this feature a lot in ICQ so that I wouldn't get interrupted by friends and 
family while working. But I also want to remain online so I can be seen by the 
rest of my team who <em>do</em> need to be able to interrupt me on occasion.

<p><span class="859301415-19062003"></span><span class="859301415-19062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">Without this feature, as soon as I go online I get assaulted 
by 100 IMs from everyone I've ever met in my life.
