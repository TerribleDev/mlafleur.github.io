<p><span class="281540118-11072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">As a customer of <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com">Sourcegear </a>(<a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault">Vault</a>) and <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com">Fog Creek </a>(<a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ">FogBugz</a>), I was thinking today about 
how much blogs are influencing my purchasing decisions. I don't think we 
can call it "Marketing", its more like "Blogeting". </font></span></p>
<p><span class="281540118-11072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the past I would learn about new products either from a 
friend or by seeing an advertisement. My decision to purchase was based almost 
exclusively on the demo experience. I'm sure that I missed out on a 
lot of great products simply because I didn't "get it" when I played with their 
demonstration product. If they didn't hook me within 10 minutes I moved on 
without so much as a second thought.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="281540118-11072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">But with these two 
products something different occurred; I learned about them from the 
owner's personal blog (<a href="http://software.ericsink.com/index.html">Eric 
Sink</a> of Sourcegear and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/index.html">Joel Spolsky </a>of Fog 
Creek<em>)</em>. This changed the entire sales paradigm by injecting a personal 
connection not found in normal business relationships. I found I cared more 
about them, their company, and their products. I was no longer dealing with 
"Faceless Company X" but a real human being. I was buying a product from someone 
that I knew, I liked, and wanted to be involved with. </font></span></p>
<p><span class="281540118-11072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">This connection also 
effected my demo experience. Although in both cases I found the initial releases 
didn't fit me, I didn't walk away. This was because I <em>wanted</em> to like 
their products. I liked them so much, how could I not? So I stuck around and 
eventually purchased each product when it did fit my needs (I purchased 
Vault at 1.1 and FogBugz at 3.0). And since I had watched the product grow and 
became part of the community around the product, I can't see me ever leaving.

<p><span class="281540118-11072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm a customer for 
life and that means a lot in today's market. Thanks 
guys.</font></span></p>
