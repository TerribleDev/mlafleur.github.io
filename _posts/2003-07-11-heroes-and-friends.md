<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">I'm about to leave to attend a memorial service for a childhood friend of my wife and I. His name was Seth Michaud and he was a Captain in the US Marines. On June 22 he was killed in Djibouti, Africa in a friendly fire incident. He leaves behind a wife and 18-month old son.</span></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">My wife and I grew up with Seth and many of our happiest memories include him (I once stole 31 gas caps with him for a scavenger hunt... bad bad bad). And while we have not seen him in some time, his loss hit like a ton of bricks. It reminded me that every man and woman who has given their life for my country has left behind a legacy. A legacy that I knew nothing about and thought little of, until now. I</span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">'m glad part of Seth's legacy includes me. I'm a better person for having known him and anyone who knew him will never forget. </span></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">On the Friday before his death he posted a profile on Classmates. While I try my best to maintain my macho-manliness at all times, I must admit to crying like a baby after reading his profile that Sunday night. </span></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">We all have many heroes and many friends in our lives. I was privileged enough to have someone who was both. </span></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021"></span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">Rest in peace my friend and thank you.</span></font></p>  <p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/mlafleur/WindowsLiveWriter/HeroesandFriends_CBB8/seath-michaud-photo-01_2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="seath-michaud-photo-01" src="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/mlafleur/WindowsLiveWriter/HeroesandFriends_CBB8/seath-michaud-photo-01_thumb.jpg" width="136" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021">Some links: </span></font></p>  <ul>   <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021"><a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/srmichaud.htm">http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/srmichaud.htm</a></span></font> </li>    <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="000441021"><a href="http://www.usmchangout.com/id82.htm">http://www.usmchangout.com/id82.htm</a></span></font> </li> </ul>  <p><font color="#800000" size="1">[update: fixed some broken links]</font></p>
