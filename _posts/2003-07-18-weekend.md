<p><span class="875475620-18072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is nothing 
better than 5:00 PM on Friday. A full weekend of being unplugged works wonders 
for me.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="875475620-18072003"></span><span class="875475620-18072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, being a geek and all, I also use it as a time to 
work out some of the more complex problems without the pressure of actually 
working. There is just something about geek and workaholic that go hand-in-hand. 
Even away from the keyboard, I think about code I'll work on when I get there. 
Oh well.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="875475620-18072003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am off to clean the 
paintball gun. After all, nothing takes your mind off of work better than 
getting peppered with hot-pink paint. ;-)</font></span></p></font><div><p>[Now Playing: They Might Be Giants - Istanbul (Not Constantinople) (02:38)]</p></div>
