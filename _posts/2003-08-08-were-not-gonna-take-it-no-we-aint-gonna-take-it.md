<p><span class="500290114-08082003"><font face="Arial" size="2">So here I am, happily 
working on my application. Free as a bird and not a care in the world. When 
suddenly, a 300 ton anvil comes crashing down on my fingers. And written along 
it's sideÂ is "Image List".</font></span></p>
<p><span class="500290114-08082003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I've just now added 
the same collection of images to yet another instance of an Image List for the 
gazillionth time this month. Every toolbar in my application has a common set of 
icons, and because I can't inherit/wrap/share the Image List, I'm forced to add 
it manually to every Image List control on every form. </font></span></p>
<p><span class="500290114-08082003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm not looking for 
the world, I just want a Image List that I can share with every toolbar in my 
application. And No, I don't want to create a static image list an attach it in 
code. I want it in my fancy designer damn it! (how's that for 
diplomatic?).</font></span></p>
<p><span class="500290114-08082003"><font face="Arial" size="2">So my dear friends at 
Microsoft, <strong><em>fix this</em></strong>! Or I'll be forced to throw this 
anvil back at you. </font></span></p><div><p>[Now Playing: Unknown - Chapter 7 (00:00)]</p></div>
