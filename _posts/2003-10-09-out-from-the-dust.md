<p><font face=Verdana>I've learned something this month. Ok, I learned a few things:</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana>1. Life without an internet connection is just too much to take. </font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana>2. Life with a dial-up internet connection is inexplicably more horrible that #1.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana>3. The world needs better keyboard. I'll elaborate on this one in another posting soon. But I would guess you know <em>exactly </em>what I'm talking about.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana>4. Video drivers don't work, ever, period. And even if they do, they will be broken by morning. <br /></font></p>
