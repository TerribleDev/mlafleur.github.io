Title: Blogging Blues

I've been looking for a good rich client to post to my blog with (I just don't like editing in a web page). Unfortunately I can't seem to find a workable client out there. 

NewsGator works, but only occasionally. For example, this post was first attempted from NewsGator but it never got here. This happens a good 9 out of 10 times. It is one heck of a reader, but the posting has a way to go.

w.Bloggar looks promising. But I just cannot get it to work. When I point it at weblogs.asp.net/mlafleur/services/metablogapi.aspx it just returns an XML parsing error. I know other have made it work before, but it sure seems broken now.

Any ideas out there?

UPDATE: It seems my issues are related to a bug in .Text rather than the client software.
