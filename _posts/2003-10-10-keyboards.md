<p>I am on a &#8220;great quest&#8221; to find a keyboard that, to put it bluntly, does not suck. It started out as a tiny &#8220;errand&#8220;, turned into a &#8220;hunt&#8220;, and then escalated all the way up to &#8220;great quest&#8220; in a matter of days. And if I do not find a answer soon, I fear I may have to jump right past &#8220;epic quest&#8221; status and head straight to &#8220;ludicrous obsession&#8221;.</p>
<p>Every keyboard I have tried in some 6 odd stores has been some variation of the &#8220;mushy key&#8221; keyboards. I personal feel that such keyboards hold all of the elegance of typing on a napkin and are all so sensitive that you end up fat-fingering every other letter. </p>
<p>In my quest I have had several recommendations for <a target='top' href="http://www.keytronic.com/home/keyboards/keyboards.html">KeyTronic keyboards</a>. They are nice, but I'm not a fan of the L-Enter style keyboard and the only black, non-L-Enter, keyboards they have come in funky ergonomic shapes. And I'm not sure I would find that a comfortable fit.</p>
<p>The other recommendation was for <a target='top' href="http://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp keyboards</a>. These guys actually make the old buckling-spring keyboards&nbsp;they IBM and Lexmark made famous. This looked the most promising, but they don't seem to offer a keyboard in black that also includes&nbsp;the Windows keys (unless I go with the integrated mouse combo).&nbsp; Too bad too because I really love this style of keyboard.</p>
<p>Given they I type for a living, my keyboard matters a lot to me. Most people think its overkill, but I imagine I would find Tiger Woods overly picky about his golf clubs. </p>
<p>So what is your keyboard of choice? And more importantly, where can I get one. ;-)</p>
