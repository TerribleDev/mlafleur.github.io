Excerpt: ""

<p>I just received my latest MSDN installment and found, to much delight, that they have finally <a target='top' href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/default.asp#first">redesigned the DVD set</a> so that each DVDs content and color has actual meaning. And even more important, the yellow disks now use black text rather than white (the white on yellow was flat out illegible). </p>
<p>My compliments to the MSDN crew; fantastic job guys.</p>
