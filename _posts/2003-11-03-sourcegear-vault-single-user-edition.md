<a href="http://www.sourcegear.com">SourceGear</a> has released a single user version of their <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault">Vault </a>product for $49. This makes Vault an absolutely fantastic solution for solo developers. At a few hundred bucks for Vault, I would have stuck with CVS for my personal projects. But for $49? Hell, even this cheap bastard can swing that.

UPDATE: It doesn't seem to have hit their website fully, but I've hear that will be fixed shortly.
