<P>Every once and a while I'm reminded why I respect Red Hat. I'm not a Linux fan but these guys are least &#8220;get it&#8221;.</P>
<P>As&nbsp;<A href="http://www.activewin.com/awin/comments.asp?HeadlineIndex=20886">reported by ActiveWin today</A>, Red Hat CEO Matthew&nbsp;Szulik said recently that &#8220;Linux needs to mature further before home users will get a positive experience from the operating system&#8220; and that home users &#8220;should choose Windows instead&#8221;. </P>
<P>It sure is refreshing to hear someone from the Linux side of the fence finally admit that my Grandmother isn't going to get anything out of having a Linux box at home. <BR></P>
