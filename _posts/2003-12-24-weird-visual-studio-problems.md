Title: Weird Visual Studio Problems

<div class="Section1"> I am having some weird problems with Visual Studio lately.
 Here you are working on a window all happy and smiling. You go away from the designer for a second (to build, work on code, whatever) and when you come back things are missing. Big things like that grid you spent and hour on.
 And when I say missing, I only mean from the designer. The code for the objects still seems to be there and it is still listed in the properties box object list. And about 50% of the time you can close Visual Studio and reopen with everything back in place (that is assuming you didn&#8217;t compile or otherwise save mucked up version).
 Right now it happens about 15-20 times per day but sometimes it is much worse. And it doesn&#8217;t just happen to me, it happens everywhere. So I must be wasting at least two hours a day just waiting for Visual Studio to open and close. Yuk.
 Anyway, it just happened and I felt the need to vent. Thanks for listening.
