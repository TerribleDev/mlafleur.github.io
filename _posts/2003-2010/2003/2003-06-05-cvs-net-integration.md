<p><span class="437460716-05062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">Source Code Control is 
an absolute passion of mine. I get physically ill at the mere though of 
developing software without it. I could go on for hours about how important it 
is to understand and use source control, but I'll save you the pain of reading 
it. I'll just say this; If you don't use it, go pound sand. How is 
that?</font></span></p>
<p><span class="437460716-05062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">One of my all time 
favorite source control systems is CVS (StarBase gets top honors, but at 
$6,000,000,000 per seat they don't get my business). The great thing about CVS 
is that it is very flexible and completely free. Don't get me wrong, there are 
defiantly issues with it, but most of them can be ignored. Especially in the 
face of it being "free".</font></span></p>
<p><span class="437460716-05062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is however one major issue that has prevented me from 
using CVS in the last few years, no IDE integration with Visual Studio. There 
were some tools out there like </font><a title="Click here to do a full-text search for this title" href="/assets/wp/2003/06/igloo"><font face="Arial" size="2">JalindiIgloo</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">, but they just didn't cut 
it (really, it flat out doesn't work...).</font></span></p>
<p><span class="437460716-05062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I could have just used 
an external IDE to manage it like </font><a href="/assets/wp/2003/06/www.wincvs.org"><font face="Arial" size="2">WinCvs< or or </font><a href="/assets/wp/2003/06/www.tortoisecvs.org"><font face="Arial" size="2">TortoiseCVS</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">. But WinCvs offends my UI 
sensibilities. It deserves a Life Time Achievement award from the UI Hall Of 
Shame. And while I do like TortoiseCVS, it just doesn't feel comfortable to 
manage source code from within the Explorer. To CVS wasn't much of an option for 
a long time.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="437460716-05062003">
<font size="2">Then I found the 
"<a href="http://www.pushok.com/soft_short_info.php?PHPSESSID=97696e55b788cef1ad8b0e1329854501">CVS 
SCC Proxy</a>" plug-in from <a href="/assets/wp/2003/06/www.pushok.com">PushOK 
Software</a>. The basic concept is that the PushOK Proxy 100% mimics Visual 
Source Safe. This means that you get all of the integration benefits of Visual 
Source Safe with solid support of CVS behind it. Oh, and it is Free as 
well. </font></span></p>

<font size="2"><span class="437460716-05062003">I cannot over 
exaggerate how cool this little tool is. And I cannot tell you how happy I am to 
finally be able to use CVS with Visual Studio and not have to handle anything 
outside the IDE . T</span><span class="437460716-05062003">he best part is that I 
can now <a href="/assets/wp/2003/06/HowSourceControlIntegrati.html">intergrate 
</a>my <a href="/assets/wp/2003/06/FogBUGZ">FogBugs </a>database with my 
source control.</span></font></p>
<p><span class="437460716-05062003"><font face="Arial" size="2">I've tested this 
product with Visual Studio 2002, Visual Studio 2003, Visual Basic 6.0, and 
Visual C++ 6.0. I found no problems using the tool this any of them.

find an ASP.NET browser for the CVS repository....
