Still not enough <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mlafleur/posts/34587.aspx" target=_blank>free</a> <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mlafleur/posts/34590.aspx" target=_blank>stuff</a> for you tonight? How about one more?

Microsoft released a free <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/default.aspx" target=_blank>Visual Basic .NET Resource kit</a>. And even if you are not a VB developer, it is worth a look. Among it's contents are free (yes, as in beer) copies of several big name .NET components:

<ul>
<li><b>ComponentOne Studio Enterprise<br /></b>A comprehensive collection of more than 30 high-quality WinForms and ASP.NET Web controls including grid components, reporting components, charting components, data components, user-interface components, and e-commerce components. </li>
<li><b>Dundas Chart For Windows Forms, Professional Edition<br /></b>Developed for rich-client .NET applications, this fully-managed charting control gives you all the features of a premium charting control. This functionality combined with incredible design-time support allows for the fast and easy creation of sensational looking charts that have the exact look and feel that you require. </li>
<li><b>Infragistics UltraWebNavigator and UltraWinTree Controls<br /></b>UltraWinTree delivers an advanced .NET tree control that surpasses the look and functionality of the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET TreeView control. UltraWebNavigator is the first tool to provide a simple, easy-to-use designer to create menu and tree hierarchies, making it possible for Web masters and non-programmers to build eye-popping navigation systems and outlines visually, without writing code. </li>
<li><b>Sax Software Corp<br /></b>Sax.net Communications makes it easy to add scalable serial communications to all your .NET applications. </li></ul>
When people ask why I develop for Windows, I always point to things like this. Microsoft real does bend over backwards to ensure developing applications for their platform is both easy and affordable.
