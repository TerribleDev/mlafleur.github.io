Yes, I'm sharing a mushy story about my kids. But hey, it has technical content. Think of it as a study in youth UI design...

My wife and I often chat during the day using IM. Whenever my daughter asks what my wife is doing, she typically replies "talking to your father". Sometimes she even tells my wife to relay a message to me. 

Well today my wife walked into the home office and found my daughter saying "are you there daddy". When my wife asked what she was doing she responded with a huff, "trying to talk to daddy on the computer".

That made my day. There, I shared.
