One of the more interesting features in Google&#8217;s new Chrome browser is &#8220;Application Shortcuts&#8221;. These are web site links that Chrome places on your Start menu, Desktop and/or Quick Launch bar. When launched they open with a trimmed down UI, giving the web application a decidedly &#8220;desktop&#8221; feel. I&#8217;ve created shortcuts for a number of applications, including my GMail account. 
  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:8747F07C-CDE8-481f-B0DF-C6CFD074BF67:2f33097c-edc6-41c6-b4ea-cf089acf3fb1" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: right; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/mlafleur/WindowsLiveWriter/ISnappedMyChrome_9875/aw_snap-8x6.jpg" title="Chrome Snapped At Me" rel="thumbnail"><img border="0" src="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/mlafleur/WindowsLiveWriter/ISnappedMyChrome_9875/aw_snap_337.png" /></a></div>  Today, while responding to an email, I got what is best described as a &#8220;black screen of death&#8221;. Chrome informed me that &#8220;Ah, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage. To continue, press Reload or go to another page&#8221;.
  Aside from being a rather silly error message, it tells me nothing of value. I don&#8217;t know what went wrong. It doesn&#8217;t help me diagnose if it was Chrome that failed or the site it was viewing. And the methods suggested for resolving this error are not valid in &#8220;shortcut mode&#8221; as there are no toolbar items to press or URL boxes to navigate with. 
  One aspect of this message that I like is that it assumes the user isn&#8217;t an expert. It doesn&#8217;t shove a bunch of technical information at the poor user who cannot do anything with it anyway. Why needlessly make things confusing? 
  The problem is that they didn&#8217;t give any obvious way to get at the technical information for those who <em>can </em>make use of it. And if you&#8217;re going to go with the simplicity route then you need to make sure your error message gives a working resolution to the user. That novice user isn&#8217;t going to make the same assumption that I did and press F5 to reload the page.
