I came back from vacation to find that I was unable to login to OCS. Turns out that an update installed on 10/14 broke the front-end services for OCS. The event log shows the following error:
<blockquote>The evaluation period for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2Â  has expired. Please upgrade from the evaluation version to the full released version of the product.</blockquote>
Uninstalling the KB974581 update corrected the problem.

Big thanks to Dietmar Kraume's blog post at <a title="http://tinyurl.com/yjefeg9" href="http://tinyurl.com/yjefeg9">http://tinyurl.com/yjefeg9</a> for pointing to the solution.
