The press releases went up a few minutes ago so I can finally share this.
  The overly long winded name Microsoft Office Communications Server is no more. The entire product line (including Office Communicator) has been rebranded as "Lync". 
  The new product line will include:
  <ul>   <li>Lync 2010 (replaces Communicator) </li>    <li>Lync Server 2010 (replaces Office Communications Server) </li>    <li>Lync Online (replaces Communications Online) </li>    <li>Lync Web App (replaces Web Communicator) </li> </ul>  You can read the full press release here: <a title="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/sep10/LyncPR.mspx" href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/sep10/LyncPR.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/sep10/LyncPR.mspx</a>
