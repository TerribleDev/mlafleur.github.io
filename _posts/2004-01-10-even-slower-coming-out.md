<div class="Section1"> <p>Somewhere along the lines I damaged my Visual Studio install and tonight I decided to just uninstall and reinstall. I planned on a few hours as we all know what a bear it can to be installing this bugger.</p> <p>Well I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible, but Visual Studio takes even <i><span style='font-style:italic'>longer</span></i> to uninstall than install. Plan on seeing a log of postings tonight, I&rsquo;m going to have some free time&hellip;. Ug.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>
