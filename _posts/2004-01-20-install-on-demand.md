<div class="Section1"> Can we please put a stop to this Install on Demand madness? I know it is very cool that it will install some template only when I need it. I understand that this is very slick. I get it. But please stop it!
  
 Every time I start Visio 2003 it asks me for the CD-ROM. I have no idea why, but it wants it. The problem isn&rsquo;t that I lack the CD, it is that I have too many of them (MSDN, Action Pack, Retail&hellip;). And not one of them has the damn file this thing wants. The best part is that if I click &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; it loads Visio anyway. If this file is so damn important than how does it run at all? It acts like my 2 year old, passionately demanding something that it has absolutely no need for. And sometimes, also like my 2 year old, it needs to be told &ldquo;no&rdquo; (or in this case, &ldquo;cancel&rdquo;) multiple times before it gets the point.
  
 Hard drive space is cheep guys. This technology may be cool but you are 5 years late bringing it to the table. With the price of disk space these days, just let me install the whole damn thing and leave me be already!
  
 I need to find a wall to bang my head against&hellip;
