<P>A few days ago I made mention of a <A title=http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/ href="http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/" target=_blank>.NET Logging Framework</A> I had been using (and still am, and still loving).&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was one small change that needed to be made to the source in order to compile it under .NET 1.1. There is a warning generated by LogSocketReader.cs about an obsolete TcpListener method call (@line 164). &nbsp;I figured I&#8217;d just post the code fix here and save someone 10 minutes looking for the solution.</P>
<P>The fix is to change the call to:</P>
<P><SPAN>System.Net.IPAddress ipAddress = System.Net.Dns.Resolve("localhost").AddressList[0];</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>TcpListener = <FONT color=blue><SPAN>new</SPAN></FONT> TcpListener(ipAddress, Port);</SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIV>
