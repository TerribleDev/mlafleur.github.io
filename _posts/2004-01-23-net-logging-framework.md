Title: .NET Logging Framework

<div>
A few days ago I made mention of a <a title=http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/ href="http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/" target=_blank>.NET Logging Framework</a> I had been using (and still am, and still loving). 

There was one small change that needed to be made to the source in order to compile it under .NET 1.1. There is a warning generated by LogSocketReader.cs about an obsolete TcpListener method call (@line 164).  I figured I&#8217;d just post the code fix here and save someone 10 minutes looking for the solution.

The fix is to change the call to:

System.Net.IPAddress ipAddress = System.Net.Dns.Resolve("localhost").AddressList[0];

TcpListener = <span>new TcpListener(ipAddress, Port);</span>
