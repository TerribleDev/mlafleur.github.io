<div>
<p>A few days ago I made mention of a <a title=http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/ href="http://www.theobjectguy.com/dotnetlog/" target=_blank>.NET Logging Framework</a> I had been using (and still am, and still loving).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was one small change that needed to be made to the source in order to compile it under .NET 1.1. There is a warning generated by LogSocketReader.cs about an obsolete TcpListener method call (@line 164). &nbsp;I figured I&#8217;d just post the code fix here and save someone 10 minutes looking for the solution.</p>
<p>The fix is to change the call to:</p>
<p><span>System.Net.IPAddress ipAddress = System.Net.Dns.Resolve("localhost").AddressList[0];</span></p>
<p><span>TcpListener = <font color=blue><span>new</span></font> TcpListener(ipAddress, Port);</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
