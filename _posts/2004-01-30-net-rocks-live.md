<a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/" target=_blank>Rory Blyth</a> is just too damn funny for a <a href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/" target=_blank>show that runs during working hours</a>. It is a little hard to call anything &#8220;work related&#8221; when one spends the entire time bursting into laughter.

And my thoughts on what Microsoft does with the hackers people turn in? They drag them into the basement of Building 6 (why 6? because why not 6&#8230;) and force them to listen to Steve Ballmer shout &#8220;<a href="http://www.ntk.net/media/developers.mpg" target=_blank>Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers</a>&#8221; for 48 hours (or until Mr. Ballmer collapses due to lack of oxygen).

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: It just occurred to me that Seems that Steve Ballmer and Howard Dean <em>must</em> share the same speech writer.
