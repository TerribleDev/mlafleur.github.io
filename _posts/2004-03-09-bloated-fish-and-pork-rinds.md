<div class="Section1"> <p>I installed the corporate edition of Symantec AntiVirus&nbsp;for the first time yesterday. And aside from the poor quality of their documentation (my god this thing is confusing) I think I like it. But I found their licensing model quite amusing.</p> <p>To license the product you go to a special website (the address for which is in .005 point type at the bottom of a page) and enter your license key. They then check that key and generate a license file, which they then proceed to <i><span style='font-style:italic'>email to you!</span></i></p> <p>I found it odd that with the vast majority of viruses being sent by emails these days, an Anti-Virus company would be <i><span style='font-style:italic'>using</span></i> attachments in their licensing scheme. This is especially true when you consider that a number of virus experts are pushing companies to outright ban file attachments at the mail server!</p> <p>This got me to thinking about what it would be like were Symantec to take over the medical profession&hellip;.</p> <p><b><span style='; font-weight:bold'>Patient:</span></b> Doctor, do you have a cure for cancer?<br /> <b><span style='font-weight:bold'>Doctor:</span></b> Yep. Just smoke 2 of these and call me in the morning.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ll save you from my extended version which included an AIDS prevention involving sex with 42 heroin addicts.</p></div>
