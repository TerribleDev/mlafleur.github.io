<div class="Section1"> I was looking for a very simple plug-in architecture today so I &ldquo;went a Google&rsquo;n &ldquo;.  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove" target="_blank">Roy</a> had a great little article (see &ldquo;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/articles/7610.aspx" target="_blank">Add run-time functionality to your application by providing a plug-in mechanism</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/articles/8048.aspx" target="_blank">Search dynamically for plugins without Config Files</a>&rdquo;) on the how to build one that worked out perfectly.
 Most articles, on any technical topic, seem to spend most of their time talking around the subject rather than giving me a solution I can actually use. I&rsquo;m sure some will argue that this is because &ldquo;theory is important&rdquo; and that is all well and good. But sometimes I think it has more to too with proving the author&rsquo;s intellectual superiority than some the reader&rsquo;s education.  Roy does not seem to have this problem. And whenever I&rsquo;m looking for a quick fix of just the facts, Roy always seems to have the answer.
