<div class="Section1"> <p>In a life devoid of much entertainment (I&rsquo;m posting at 9:39 PM from my office right now) I&rsquo;m left with getting what little I can out of meaningless events. And tonight I managed to find one such event.</p> <p>Upon visiting the new <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>, I was able to create a user &ndash; get this - using only my first name. That&rsquo;s right! No assortment of random letters and numbers after my name. No wasted time trying to think of an amusing handle that will both make me look humorous and yet still too cool to be a geek. Nope, not this time. It is just pain ole &ldquo;Marc&rdquo; for me.</p> <p>You&rsquo;re envious I know.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>
