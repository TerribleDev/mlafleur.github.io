<div class="Section1"> Hmm, so <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/CFranklin/archive/2004/04/14/113178.aspx" target="_blank">Carl and Rory</a> are thinking about a more broad reaching radio show. I like the idea, but this line caught me off guard:
 <i>I don't want it to be Oprah, though. So, we're not going to talk about the things most talk shows are focused on.</i>
 Well, I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you but I&rsquo;m saddened to hear this. I was <i>sure</i> Rory was next in line for Oprah&rsquo;s job. I guess this means I loose the office pool. Damn it&hellip;
