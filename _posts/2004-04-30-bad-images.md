<p>Seems I&#8217;ve been so busy, I&#8217;ve let my blog get a bit stale. I&#8217;ve been knee deep into our current project and between that and maintaining our existing product in the field; I&#8217;ve been nailed. &nbsp;What finally put me over the edge was a set of presentations I delivered last weekend in Baltimore, MD. It ate up any remaining seconds I had. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, at least now I have a picture to prove that seeing one of my presentations <a href="http://dev.genesisfour.com/images/marclafleur_4_2004.jpg" target=_blank>really is a religious experience</a>. :-)</p></div>
