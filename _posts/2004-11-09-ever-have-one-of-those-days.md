<div class="Section1"> Ever have one of those days where you can&rsquo;t seem to remember where you put your brain? Well, I&rsquo;ve been having one for the last few months now. Either that or the little green men really do exist and <a href="http://www.abduct.com/irm.htm" target="_blank">I should get an IRM</a> as soon as possible.
 Things have been busy around here as we launch into the final stretch of development on our next big release. As this release is a complete re-write into Microsoft .NET and SQL Server there are, needless to say, a few extra hours required. But after 2 years of development, at least we can see the end of the road. I can&rsquo;t remember the color of my house, the price of milk, or my wife&rsquo;s name but who cares! It&rsquo;s beta time baby.
 Once things get into full beta I plan on picking up my posting again (and locating my family). I also plan to put up a post-mortem on the project. Hopefully it will help someone avoid mistakes I made alone the way (not that I made <i>any</i> mistakes mind you&hellip;.).
 Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I need to get started on my <a href="http://www.abduct.com/survey.htm" target="_blank">Alien Abduction Survey</a>.
