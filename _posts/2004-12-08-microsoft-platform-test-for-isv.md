<div class="Section1"> I just got word from VeriTest that our product just passed the <a href="http://www.veritest.com/certification/ms/platformtest.asp" target="_blank">MS platform test</a>. So I&rsquo;ll use this soapbox to thank the team and the testers around me that managed to pull it off.
 For those that haven&rsquo;t gone though it, it is much easier than you think. Especially if you are a .NET application because a large percentage of the test is simply not applicable; the framework handles it for you (and an major installation package will handle another chunk). The only advice I would give is to not be afraid to ask questions. I was amazed how responsive they were to giving me detailed information on what exactly to document, how best to supply, etc.
 I&rsquo;d also like to send a shout out to Jim Stull, our Microsoft ISV Partner Group rep. He really helped us nail down what we needed to do, got us in touch with the people we needed, and generally made the entire process effortless. Someone should promote this guy&hellip;. Wait! Don&rsquo;t listed to me! Forget that. <i>Just leave him right where he is!</i> :-)
