<div class="Section1"> <a href="http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/" target="_blank">Julia Lerman&rsquo;s blog</a> got a nod along side <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/" target="_blank">Robert Scoble</a> and <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/activity-log.php" target="_blank">Miguel de Icaza</a> (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Blog World&rdquo;, CODE Magazine, Jan/Feb 2005). Well worth reading if you don&rsquo;t already. Aside from the great tips it is often just damn funny to read.
 Now maybe she&rsquo;ll admit she really <i>does</i> know what she is doing, and is damn good at it too. Congratulations; it is well deserved.
