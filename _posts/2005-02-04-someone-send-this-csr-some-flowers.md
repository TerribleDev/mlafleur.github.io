<p>Sure, it is a crank call, but it is amusing as all hell and not far off the mark. Take a&nbsp;listen for yourself&nbsp;at <a href="http://www.failedlife.com/TDLmovies/shadowbane_crying.mp3">http://www.failedlife.com/TDLmovies/shadowbane_crying.mp3</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Whomever took this call should really get a promotion for not simply screaming at this guy. </p> <p>Thanks for <a href="http://www.brokentoys.org/index.php?p=6643">Scott </a>(a.k.a. Lum The Mad) for posting a link to this. </p>
