Almost 3 weeks without a smoke. Now I just need to figure out what to do with these 10lbs I've seemed to have picked up along the way. Maybe I could use my new lung capacity for vigorous exorcise.... yeah, that will happen.. 
 So far the only side effects are the 10lbs and the strong desire to randomly strangle people on the street with a dirty sock. But I'm adjusting. :)
