<p>Almost 3&nbsp;weeks without a smoke. Now I just need to figure out what to do with these 10lbs I've seemed to have picked up along the way. Maybe I could use my new lung capacity&nbsp;for vigorous&nbsp;exorcise.... yeah, that will happen.. </p> <p>So far the only side effects are the 10lbs and the strong desire to randomly strangle people on the street with a dirty sock. But I'm adjusting. :)</p>
