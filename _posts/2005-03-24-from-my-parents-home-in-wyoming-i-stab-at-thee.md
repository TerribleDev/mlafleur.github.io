<p>If your a fan of Penny Arcade, or just like a good rub on the Slash Dot crowd, you'll like this one from their comic archive: <a href="http://img.penny-arcade.com/2002/20020722l.gif">http://img.penny-arcade.com/2002/20020722l.gif</a></p> <p>For some reason you can't get at this from the archive web page they have up, but the direct link works fine. </p>
