I got a only of those "low rater mortgage loan" spam messages today. The first line said the following:

<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><font color=#006400 size=2>
"This will be our 4th and last final attempt to reach you regarding your low rate approval."
</font></blockquote>
Really? Do you promise?
