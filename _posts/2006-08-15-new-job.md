It seems I'm one of those "<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/a-week-in-montana-did-me-some-good/" target=_blank mce_href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/a-week-in-montana-did-me-some-good/">lame bloggers who doesn't say much</a>". Truth be told, I've just never had much of interest to say. But maybe that will change now.

This month I accepted a job with <a href="http://www.parlancecorp.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.parlancecorp.com/">Parlance Corporation</a>. Their flagship product is called nameConnector. It is a managed appliance that - among a number other things - integrates with a company's phone system allowing you to reach people by simply stating a person's name or a location ("Conference Room One" or "John Smith"). 

I'll be working with some exciting technology including speech recognition and VoiceXML. And I'll be building a number of internal and customer-facing tools using C#, Windows Forms, ASP.NET, and Python (including Iron Python). It has been awhile since I was this excited about writing software. I've missed this feeling. 

So who knows, maybe now I'll have some more interesting things to talk about.

Maybe. 

Don't hold your breath though... :)
