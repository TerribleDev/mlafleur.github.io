<p>It seems I'm one of those "<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/a-week-in-montana-did-me-some-good/" target=_blank mce_href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/14/a-week-in-montana-did-me-some-good/">lame bloggers who doesn't say much</a>". Truth be told, I've&nbsp;just never had much of interest to say. But maybe that will change now.</p>
<p>This month I accepted a job with <a href="http://www.parlancecorp.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.parlancecorp.com/">Parlance Corporation</a>. Their flagship product is called nameConnector. It is a managed appliance that - among&nbsp;a number other things - integrates with a company's phone system allowing you to reach&nbsp;people by simply stating a person's name or a location ("Conference Room One" or "John Smith"). </p>
<p>I'll be working with some exciting technology including speech recognition and&nbsp;VoiceXML. And I'll be building a number of internal and customer-facing tools using C#, Windows Forms, ASP.NET, and Python (including Iron Python). It has been awhile <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">since </span>I was this excited about writing software. I've missed this feeling. </p>
<p>So who knows, maybe now I'll have some more interesting things to talk about.</p>
<p>Maybe. </p>
<p>Don't hold your breath though... :)</p>
