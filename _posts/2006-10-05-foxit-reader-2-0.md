<p>I just noticed that Foxit Reader 2.0 was release last month. For those of you not familiar with Foxit Reader then you should really check it out. Foxit is a free PDF reader that fixes almost all of my gripes with Adobe Reader - namely that it starts instantly and uses as little memory as possible. </p> <p>Check it out - <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/">http://www.foxitsoftware.com/</a></p>
