<p>Not that I'm really very surprised but Outlook 2007 will not connect to Exchange 5.5. I found a note about this on the <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=763464&amp;SiteID=17" target="_blank">TechNet Forums</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Microsoft continuously strives to provide a consistent and predictable end-of-life-cycle experience for all of its products.&nbsp; In accordance with standard Microsoft life-cycle policies Exchange 5.5 ended extended life-cycle support on January 10, 2006.&nbsp; As a result, Outlook 2007 will not support Exchange 5.5.&nbsp; Because neither the Outlook or Exchange team is supporting this combination we will not discover and/or fix issues that crop up as the result of innovations in both products .&nbsp; Rather than subjecting customers to potential serious issues like data loss or frequent server downtime we choose to prevent Outlook from connecting to these older and now unsupported servers.&nbsp; Our research has shown that there is a relatively small set of customers who want to upgrade their desktops to the latest and greatest versions of Office and run server technology as old as Exchange 5.5.&nbsp; There are clearly exceptions but they don't seem to be the norm."</p></blockquote> <p>Something to keep in mind if, like me, you need to connect to an Exchange 5.5 email server.</p>
