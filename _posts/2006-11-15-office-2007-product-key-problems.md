<p>Seems there is a bit of an issue with the MSDN Product Keys for Office 2007. </p>  <p>Several of the Office products share the same Product Key issued by MSDN; &quot;Office 2007 Desktop Programs&quot; is used for Groove. InfoPath, and OneNote and both Project and Visio share another one. </p>  <p>When I went to activate the assorted application on my workstation it failed for InfoPath, OneNote, and Project (Groove and Visio activated without a hitch). After some looking around I was able to find a thread in the managed MSDN newsgroups on this topic. Looks like several users have reported this problem. </p>  <p>My guess is that the licensing servers are unable to recognize which product is being activated and it assumes that you are trying to re-activate the same product again and again. They also don't seem to know these are MSDN keys that should be allowed several installations (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/faq/default.aspx#keys" target="_blank">MSDN Licensing FAQ</a>)</p>  <p>I was able to get OneNote activated over the phone (it was the only application I needed ASAP) after I explained the problem. Of course your mileage may vary. </p>  <p><em>Update: This seems to have been fixed. Also, I've turned comments off due to people using the comments to request and publish product keys. Go pirate somewhere else guys. </em></p>
