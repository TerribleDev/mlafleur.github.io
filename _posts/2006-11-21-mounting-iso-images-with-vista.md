<p>After installing Vista this weekend I started searching for a good tool for mounting ISO images. This is actually one of the few head-scratching moment I've had with Vista so far - why didn't they bake this in? </p> <p>I tried several that either didn't install, didn't work, or were in some way flaky. Finally I found a post from <a title="Mounting an ISO image in Windows Vista" href="http://www.ariankulp.com/archive/2006/06/05/1261.aspx" target="_blank">Arian Kulp</a> on <a title="Virtual CloneDrive Download" href="http://www.elby.de/fun/software/index.html">Virtual CloneDrive from Elby</a>.</p> <p>Virtual CloneDrive is a free utility to mount ISO images on Windows (including Vista). One thing I really liked was that it associates itself with the ISO images so you can simply right-click on a .ISO file and mount it directly. </p>
