<p>Prior to Windows Live ID you were able to change the primary email address on your Passport account (assuming your primary email address was a non-Hotmail address). This feature was missing from the new Windows Live ID system and once you migrated from Passport to Windows Live ID there was no going back. </p> <p>Some people (like me) who changed jobs were stuck with either creating a new Windows Live ID (and&nbsp;chucking everything associated with the old one) or continuing to use the old account with an old email address. The later option was a bit scary if, like me, your old email was being forwarded to someone else; allowing them to retrieve your password and access your account. </p> <p>On a whim I checked today and it looks like the Live team has&nbsp;rolled out the ability to change your email address. Simply go to <a title="https://accountservices.passport.net/?lc=1033" href="https://accountservices.passport.net/?lc=1033">https://accountservices.passport.net/?lc=1033</a>&nbsp;and select a new one (either a Hotmail or another external email address). </p> <p>Thanks to whomever pushed this one though. </p>
