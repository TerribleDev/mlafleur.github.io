<p>There is an interesting post over on GotSpeech.NET (<a href="http://gotspeech.net/blogs/ksteponaitis/archive/2007/09/12/vxml-vs-workflow-for-speech-server-2007.aspx">VXML vs. Workflow for Speech Server 2007</a>) that compares speech devolvement using VoiceXML vs. the Windows Workflow model available in Speech Server 2007.&#160; </p>  <p>Given that most of my work building applications in C# and ASP.NET for the <a href="http://www.nuance.com/voiceplatform/" target="_blank">Nuance Voice Platform (NVP)</a> I've got quite a lot more experience with VXML than Workflow (or SALT). I partially disagree with him when he sites a &quot;longer development cycle&quot; with VXML. It is all about familiarity with the language and platform. But for the most part I think he makes good points.</p>  <p>I think the Workflow model is interesting but I'm wary of tying myself to a single voice platform. I much prefer the flexibility of moving between <a href="http://www.nuance.com/voiceplatform/" target="_blank">Nuance</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/speech/speech2007/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/" target="_blank">Voxeo</a>, etc. as needed. Each platform brings a different strength to the table and it seems like a bad idea to limit my options at this point. </p>
