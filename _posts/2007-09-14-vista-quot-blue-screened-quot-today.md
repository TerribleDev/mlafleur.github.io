<p>Last week I got a new laptop from. It is a Dell Latitude D830 with a 15.4" wide-screen display, a Core2Duo, and 4GB of RAM running Vista Ultimate. I really liked this model because I can run it with two monitors (using the optional docking system). 
</p><p>So far I've things have been running great. This morning while opening an email in Outlook however - Vista "blue screened". I really can't remember the last time I've seen one (years I think).

</p>One feature of Vista that impressed me was the "Problem Reports and Solutions" control panel. Vista seems to do a good job of keeping track of what application and system failures you've run in to and offers some tools to help you track down solutions.
