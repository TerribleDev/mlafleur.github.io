<p>Around 18 months ago I started a new position with Parlance Corporation. I&#8217;m proud to say I've delivered my first product - <a href="http://www.notiva.com" target="_blank">Notiva</a>.</p>  <p>Essentially Notiva is an outbound messaging service which gives developers the ability to add voice, email, and SMS messaging to any application, infrastructure, or architecture with just a few lines of code.</p>  <p>It has been a while since I've last rolled out a completely new product. This has been, without question, one of the most rewarding products I've every worked on. Frankly it has been an absolute blast to work on this. </p>  <p>I'm really excited about Notiva and where it is headed. We're working on the final touches of a full application build on Notiva now. We've already had one partner <a href="http://www.automation.com/store/p1030details27064.php" target="_blank">integrate it into an existing product</a> already. </p>  <p>If you would like to give it a try you can drop me an email or check out <a href="http://www.notiva.com">www.notiva.com</a>. </p>
