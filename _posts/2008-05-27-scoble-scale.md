<p>Robert Scoble has an interesting <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/05/26/should-services-charge-super-users/" mce_href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/05/26/should-services-charge-super-users/" target="_blank">post in response</a> to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/05/25/in-twitters-scoble-problem-a-business-model/" mce_href="http://gigaom.com/2008/05/25/in-twitters-scoble-problem-a-business-model/" target="_blank">Om Malik's suggestion that Twitter start charging</a> "Super Users". Scoble would qualify as an edge-case when comes to social network . He has a history of hitting the limits like these on <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/27.html#a8166" mce_href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/27.html#a8166" target="_blank">MSN Messenger</a> and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/14/facebook-sucks-dave-winer-says/" mce_href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/14/facebook-sucks-dave-winer-says/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. </p>  <p>Charging seems like an acceptable action to take for users like Robert who use these services at such a level. Robert is obviously getting business value out of these services and it is perfectly reasonable to get revenue from that. But I agree with Robert when he says that this won't completely solve their scalability problems. The amount they would have to charge would likely exceed the value of the service. </p>  <p>I also hope that Robert is correct in his assertion that Twitter's problem isn't caused by how it manages the data. If Assetbar is correct in <a href="http://assetbar.wordpress.com/2008/02/08/twitter-proxy-any-interest/" mce_href="http://assetbar.wordpress.com/2008/02/08/twitter-proxy-any-interest/" target="_blank">his description</a> then Twitter has a problem. I have no knowledge as to how Twitter works under the covers but I sure hope Assetbar's description isn't accurate. </p>  <p>I think we need to add another level to our description of scale: Small, Large , Enterprise and now Scoble Scale. Maybe he should rent himself out as a testing framework for social networks...</p>
