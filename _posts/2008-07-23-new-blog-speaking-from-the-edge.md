<p>I've started a new blog over on <a href="http://gotspeech.net/" target="_blank">GotSpeech.net</a> called <a href="http://gotspeech.net/blogs/speakingfromtheedge" target="_blank">Speaking From the Edge</a>. It covers topics related to voice-enabled application development including Microsoft Speech Server.&#160; </p>  <p>I'm not abandoning this site however. I will continue to post here as well. I'm also putting some thought to re-launching this blog to focus on other topics I'm interested in. </p>
