<p>The Mono Project <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/news/archive/2008/Oct-06.html" target="_blank">has hit 2.0</a>. They seem to have done a lot of work around ASP.NET, Windows Forms, and ADO support. </p>  <p>It has been a while since I've poked around with Mono. Maybe it is time for me to take another look. Time to steal my children's Mac for a few days I think. :)</p>
