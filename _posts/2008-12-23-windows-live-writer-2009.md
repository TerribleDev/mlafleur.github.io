I updated my Windows Live Writer to the 2009 release candidate today. I've been a fan of WLW for a long time and this update seems like a nice incremental step forward. <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/12/21/testing-out-the-latest-windows-live-writer/" target="_blank">Scoble seems to like it too</a>. 
  You can download the new version from <a title="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/</a>. It includes updates to the entire library of Windows Live applications (including a nice update of Messenger)
  The only thing on my wish list is built in support for cross-posting to multiple blogs.
