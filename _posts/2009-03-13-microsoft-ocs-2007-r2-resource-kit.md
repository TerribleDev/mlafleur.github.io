<p>I've just finished reading the Microsoft Office Communications server 2007 R2 Resource Kit (yes I know, I read a resource kit cover to cover. I'm a geek+ this week).&#160; If you're going to be working with OCS 2007 R2 then do yourself a favor and pick this book up. </p>  <p>They do a great job at covering the OCS architecture and outlining implementation scenarios. There are a lot of different bits involved with deploying OCS and they cover each of them. They also include some helpful troubleshooting along side.</p>  <p>From a developer's perspective it is important to understand how OCS is deployed. Understanding how certificates are used for authentication for example is vital before you attempt to get your first Hello World off the ground. </p>  <p>Unfortunately they don't cover Speech Server or the new UCMA 2.0 API here. It would have been nice to have an overview of OCS as a development platform. But at 800+ pages I can see why they decided to no address it. </p>  <p>Even without API coverage this is a must have for IT Pros and Devs working with OCS.
