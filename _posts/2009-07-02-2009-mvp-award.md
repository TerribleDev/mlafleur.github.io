<p>Yesterday I received an email announcing that I had been made an MVP for my work in the Microsoft Communications Server community. This is my first MVP award. I'm very excited to be a part of the MVP program and to be a resources to others in the community. I expect Unified Communications (and OCS along with it) to experience substantial growth over the next 5 years and I'm thrilled to be a part of it. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.massivescale.com/blog_files/2009MVPAward_AD14/image001.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0px;margin-right:auto;border-right:0px;" title="image001" border="0" alt="image001" src="http://www.massivescale.com/blog_files/2009MVPAward_AD14/image001_thumb.jpg" width="138" height="215" /></a></p><img src="http://gotspeech.net/aggbug.aspx?PostID=9137" width="1" height="1">
