<p>Today I received word that I had been awarded an MVP for Microsoft Communications Server again. I'm very excited about Unified Communications and the upcoming&#160; Microsoft Communications Server "14". I'll be doing a lot of work and posting regarding UCMA 3.0 over the next few months. If you're thinking about UC development its time to start boning up on UCMA, it is where all the Microsoft UC goodness is heading.</p>  <p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/mlafleur/image001_5A92FC75.jpg"><img style="display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" title="image001" border="0" alt="image001" src="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/mlafleur/image001_thumb_4EFD3F36.jpg" width="138" height="215" /></a></p><img src="http://gotspeech.net/aggbug.aspx?PostID=10559" width="1" height="1"/>
