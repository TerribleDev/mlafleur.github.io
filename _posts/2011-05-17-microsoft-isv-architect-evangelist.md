So my soon to be title will be "Microsoft ISV Architect Evangelist".... Yeah, wasn't sure exactly what that meant either. And honestly, I'm not sure I'll <em>really </em>know until I'm in it. But I found a great description on JasonDe Lorme's <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jason-de-lorme/0/114/780" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page that it sums up:
<blockquote>ISV Architect Evangelists (aka "ISV AEs") provide architectural guidance and insight into Microsoft product roadmaps to Microsoft's most important ISVs (Independant Software Vendors) in order to accelerate their adoption of emerging Microsoft technologies. ISV AEs act as a trusted technical advisor, working to find the best overall solutions. ISV AEs can act as a resource broker to assist with locating the correct resources within Microsoft to meet ISVs needs.</blockquote>
