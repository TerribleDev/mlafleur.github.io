<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/crooks-target-apple-macs-with-malware/article2025158/" target="_blank">Popularity has its downsides.</a>

My favorite bit from the above article?

<blockquote>Independent Mac security experts believe there is enough security built into the OS X operating system to protect users, given the current level of risk.</blockquote>

This raises the question; if there is no need to protect OS X because of its built in security, why would there be a need for "Independent Mac Security Experts" in the first place?
