Sometimes I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Q#Musical_numbers" target="_blank">Avenue Q</a>Â got it wrong; The Internet is for FUD. When it comes to generating Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt the internet reigns supreme. Oh the television was good, but it has limitations. When you need to simultaneously scare the pants off someone in NYC and an uncharted island off the coast of New Guinea, only the internet will do.
